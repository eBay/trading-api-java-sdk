/**
 * Wrapper class of the GetUser call of eBay SOAP API.
 * <br>
 * <p>Title: SOAP API wrapper library.</p>
 * <p>Description: Contains wrapper classes for eBay SOAP APIs.</p>
 * <p>Copyright: Copyright (c) 2009</p>
 * <p>Company: eBay Inc.</p>
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>ItemID</code> - Specify the <strong>ItemID</strong> value for a successfully concluded listing in which the
 * requestor and target user were participants (one as seller and the other
 * as buyer). Necessary to return certain data (like an email address). Not
 * necessary if the requestor is retrieving their own data.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>UserID</code> - Specify the user whose data you want returned by the call. If not specified, eBay returns data pertaining to the
 * requesting user (as specified with the <strong>eBayAuthToken</strong> value).
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>IncludeExpressRequirements</code> - This field is deprecated.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>IncludeFeatureEligibility</code> - If the <b>IncludeFeatureEligibility</b> flag is included and set to 'true', the call response will include a <b>QualifiesForSelling</b> flag which indicates if the eBay user is eligible to sell on eBay, and a <b>IncludeFeatureEligibility</b> container which indicates which selling features are available to the user.
 * <br> <B>Output property:</B> <code>ReturnedUser</code> - This container consists of detailed information about the user specified in the call request (through the <b>UserID</b> field) or the eBay user account that is tied to the <strong>eBayAuthToken</strong> value that is passed in the call request.
 * <br><br>
 * Some sensitive data will be masked/omitted if the returned eBay user is not the person making the <b>GetUser</b> call. More information on another eBay user will be revealed to the person making the call if that person has an order relationship for an eBay listing specified in the <strong>ItemID</strong> field of the call request.
