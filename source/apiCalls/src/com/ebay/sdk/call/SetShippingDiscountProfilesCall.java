/**
 * Wrapper class of the SetShippingDiscountProfiles call of eBay SOAP API.
 * <br>
 * <p>Title: SOAP API wrapper library.</p>
 * <p>Description: Contains wrapper classes for eBay SOAP APIs.</p>
 * <p>Copyright: Copyright (c) 2009</p>
 * <p>Company: eBay Inc.</p>
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>CurrencyID</code> - The three-digit code of the currency to be used for shipping discounts on  Combined Invoice orders. A discount profile can only be associated with a listing if the <b>CurrencyID</b> value of the profile matches the <b>Item.Currency</b> value specified in a listing. This field is required if the user is adding or updating one or more shipping discount profiles.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that There is a <b>currencyID</b> attribute on all   <b>SetShippingDiscountProfiles</b> elements involving money. To avoid a call error, be sure to use the same currency type in these attributes as what is set for the <b>CurrencyID</b> field.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>CombinedDuration</code> - This field is used to specify the number of days after the purchase of an
 * item that the buyer or seller can combine multiple and mutual order
 * line items into one Combined Invoice order. In a Combined Invoice order,
 * the buyer makes one payment for all order line items, hence only unpaid
 * order line items can be combined into a Combined Invoice order.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>ModifyActionCode</code> - This field is used to set which action is being taken (<code>Add</code>, <code>Update</code>, or <code>Delete</code>) in the call. If you are adding a shipping discount rule, you will have to supply a name for that shipping discount profile. If you want to update or delete a shipping discount profile, you'll have to provide the unique identifier of this rule through the corresponding containers. The unique identifiers of these rules can be retrieved with the <b>GetShippingDiscountRules</b> call, or the seller can view these identifiers in My eBay Shipping Preferences.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>FlatShippingDiscount</code> - This container allows you to create, update, or delete a flat-rate shipping discount profile.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>CalculatedShippingDiscount</code> - This container allows you to create, update, or delete a calculated shipping discount profile.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>CalculatedHandlingDiscount</code> - This container allows you to create, update, or delete a calculated handling discount profile.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>PromotionalShippingDiscountDetails</code> - This container allows you to create, update, or delete a promotional shipping discount profile.
