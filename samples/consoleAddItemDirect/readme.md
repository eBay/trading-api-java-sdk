# consoleAddItemDirect

This is a sample console application that shows how to create a new item and list it to eBay (using AddItemCall) without using the AddItemCall wrapper
class. It prompts user to enter account and the new item information then uses AddItemCall to list the new item to eBay. Please refer to
the [README](../README.md) of samples for build instructions.
